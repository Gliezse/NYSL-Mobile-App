Dear Tom Denton,

Hello, it's me again!
I'm sending you the first version of the NYSL Webapp's URL with this document for you to see it and tell me your thoughts of it.

The info provided is the same that I told you it was going to be the last time you've heard of this, but the designs I've sent you are a little different. I've added more color, to make the app look more alive. Also re-organized the data showage to make it better for users to understand and easier to use.

Hope you like how it looks!
Best wishes,
Cristian.
